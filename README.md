# Simple Node Web Scraper

This is a simple NodeJS web scraper tool. This tool must be customized per your specific use. 

## To Use
Clone this repo or download it into your files. Run: 

```
npm init
npm install
```

Obviously, you will need both NPM and NodeJS installed. 

This scrapier relies on [Axios](https://www.npmjs.com/package/axios) and [Cheerio](https://www.npmjs.com/package/cheerio) so check their licensing before using for whatever purpose you're gonna use it for...

Once your index.js has been customized to scrape what you want, run:

```
node index.js
```
